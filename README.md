Project #1: The Game
Game: Guess the movie
Technologies Used:  Used HTML, CSS- with Bootstrap for the modal button and Javascript.

The Approach Taken: Before writing code, I developed the pseudo-code and game flow. I drew out the user interface I had in mind and the steps to be taken by the player. This then helped me in identifying what is needed in the code ( i.e. using arrays, functions, loops).

In developing the code, I tried to build the habit of unit testing- to make sure the code is working as intended before writing more lines of code. This approach also helped me understand what was happening in the code as I debug. 

I made sure to refer to documentations available if there are concepts I need clarification on and if I wanted to check a more efficient way to write code.
