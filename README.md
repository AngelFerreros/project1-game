Project #1: The Game
Game: Guess the movie
Technologies Used:
Used HTML, CSS- with Bootstrap for the modal button and Javascript.

The Approach Taken:
Before writing code, I developed the pseudo-code and game flow. I drew out the user interface I had in mind and the steps to be taken by the player. This then helped me in identifying what is needed in the code ( i.e. using arrays, functions, loops).

While developing the game, I tried to practice the habit of unit testing- to make sure the code is working as intended before continuing building it up. This approach also helped me understand what was happening in the code as I debug.

I made sure to refer to documentations available if there are concepts I need clarification on and if I wanted to check a more efficient way to write code.

Installation Instructions:
None.

Unsolved Problems:
1. The countdown timer can sometimes go into a negative number, if the timer is close to 0 and a wrong letter is clicked.
2. I wanted to put an image as a "Next button" but had problems placing the text on top of the image. I was able to adjust the style manually in the Chrome developer tool. However, applying it on my CSS sheet and updating the browser did not seem to work.
